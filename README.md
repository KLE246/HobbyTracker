# Milestone Tracker

## Document milestones and progress towards a goal of mastery

This app aims to provide a way to track one's progress in their hobbies and skills 
such as music, sports, and anything anyone could come up with. Potential information that
could be recorded include:

- number of hours spent so far practicing skill
- milestones and when they happened
- goals set in the future to reach

then to display:

- rate and trends in time spent practicing
- how often milestones have been set
- current total hours of all skills

Anyone with skills they want to start working on can use the **Milestone Tracker**
to track their own progress as well as show to others how fast <sup><sub> or slow </sub></sup>
their advancement has been.

As someone with many dropped and ongoing hobbies, a tracker like this allows easy
re-entry into old ones and further motivation for current skills. Instead of a messy
notes app on my phone, an easy to use organizational program will make entries and 
review much appealing.
