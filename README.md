## Letting bias decide the Greatest NBA Player of All Time

This application aims to allow users to have complete control over what statistics matter most
when deciding who the best basketball players are. Fans of basketball are constantly arguing
over the details that are relevant when deciding the best. Some may idealize different eras of
the sport while others discredit that very same era. Some value longevity over peak. Many
will require a specific balance of statistics when determining their chosen player. 

Knowing the subjectivity of picking the best player, the application will take user inputs on a variety
of options to determine value between:

- Points per Game vs Total Points
- Points vs Assist
- Steals vs Blocks

or to include:

- Advanced Statistics
- Position

And many more.

The internal logic of the final equations used to rank players will involve the use of 
a given statistic's **standard deviation** in comparison to the league averages of the time
frame inputted by the user. Stat valuation given by the user will be applied as **coefficients**
in the final equation.
